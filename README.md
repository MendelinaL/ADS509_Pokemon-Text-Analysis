# Project Objectives
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With there being an ever growing amount of Pokémon, it can be difficult to keep track of all the different types. With the various abilities from strengths and weaknesses to the color, we will be providing recommendations that can classify Pokémon based on the characteristics of the species. This will be used to build an application that will provide the top most probable Pokémon based on specific input.

# Project Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The datasource for this project is the PokeAPI, a RESTful API providing data from Pokemon (includes game, tv show, etc). The number of variables depend on the endpoint access, with each type of relevant data such as the Pokemon, berries, battle moves, color, and shape. The dataset includes over 1,000 pokemon along with their attributes and associated resources such as battle moves, items, and location.
